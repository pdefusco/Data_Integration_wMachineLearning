# Entity Resolution with Atlas Lineage

This repo is based off the tutorial for the Splink record linking library, the homepage for which is [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink).

#### The goal of this project is to:

1. Give a gentle introduction to Entity Resolution with the Record Linkage library. This is handy but not very scalable when dealing with large datasets.
2. Easily spin up a Spark Session and install the Splink library in CML to perform Entity Resolution on larger datasets.
3. Using Atlas and the Python Atlas Client, keep track of the datasets you compared and create custom lineage graphs.
4. Using Cloudera Operational Database, implement a realistic example of Record Linkage in conjunction with CML Jobs, Atlas and the Splink library.
